# NBA-CourtStats

NBA CourtStats is a personal web application project hosted by Firebase. It's designed to display NBA team rosters and player information all on one page. The application uses the Angular framework to send GET requests to the API called API-NBA (https://api-sports.io/documentation/nba/v2) to access current information about each NBA team.
