<h1>NBA CourtStats</h1>

NBA CourtStats is a personal web application project hosted by Firebase. It's designed to display multiple NBA team rosters and player information all on one page. The application uses the Angular framework to send GET requests to the API called API-NBA (rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/api-nba) to access current information about each NBA team. 

After gaining a lot of experience at Flyer Enterprises as a Software Developer, I revisited my previous project, Playlist Parade, and realized it was not well programmed. It didn't use services, should have utilized SCSS to avoid redundant styling, and lacked responsive web design.

That is when I decided to build NBA CourtStats where I could improve my code and try new technologies. NBA CourtStats is a similar application to my last project, Playlist Parade, but with more maintainable code, a modular architecture using services, and a fully responsive design. 

In addition, I experimented with different technologies such as ESLint, SCSS, and Vim motions to enhance my coding skills. Playlist Parade provided me with a good learning experience, while Flyer Enterprises exposed me to more complex, large-scale projects. I leveraged these experiences to create NBA CourtStats, which not only improved my coding abilities but also gave me insight into designing a codebase and using various technologies to streamline the coding process. This project motivated me to continuously pursue learning and implement best practices in software development.
